# Version to Version Modifications
v0: Only Monster, Protagonist, and Yo_RPG classes. Started adding methods to Protagonist and Monster.
v1: Added the Character class which was the superclass of Protagonist and Monster.
v2: Added new subclasses of Protagonist and Monster. 3 each.
v3: Removed unnecessary methods from the new 6 superclasses. Also removed unncessary methods from Protagonist and Monster because thye were already in Character class. Modified Yo_RPG so it would let the user choose the protagonist to play as and monster to fight.

# Future Modifications
Add characters that don't just have different stats but rather special traits/abilities.
Fighting more than one monster at a time.
Displaying remaining health of everyone after each hit.
Boosts (random drops that can give increased damage, heal hp, etc...)
