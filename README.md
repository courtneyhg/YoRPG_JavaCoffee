**Version to Version Modifications** <br />
v0: Only Monster, Protagonist, and Yo_RPG classes. Started adding methods to Protagonist and Monster. <br />
v1: Added the Character class which was the superclass of Protagonist and Monster. <br />
v2: Added new subclasses of Protagonist and Monster. 3 each. <br />
v3: Removed unnecessary methods from the new 6 superclasses. Also removed unncessary methods from Protagonist and Monster because thye were already in Character class. Modified Yo_RPG so it would let the user choose the protagonist to play as and monster to fight.

**Future Modifications** <br />
Add characters that don't just have different stats but rather special traits/abilities. <br />
Fighting more than one monster at a time. <br />
Displaying remaining health of everyone after each hit. <br />
Boosts (random drops that can give increased damage, heal hp, etc...) <br />
